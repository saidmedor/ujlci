              <p> Our surrogate mother who is the Earth must be viable regardless of the weather for us and for future generations in order to be able to carry out all actions and contribute to the development of society. <br> This is why our principle of action N1 is based on ecology. <br> We defend the resources of our cocoon, which are not inexhaustible, on the contrary and condemn all the detractors of our mother. <br> Between herbicides, food preservatives, hormones growth found in cattle food for example, poaching and deforestation and so on, it is us, the fruits of our Earth and our Earth that are endangered. <br> Our role in safeguarding our ecosystem is therefore important and can have an incomparable impact on the evolution of situations, because it is by uniting that we succeed in creating a movement, an energy. <br> We are GREEN, we are GREEN, we are EARTH. </p>

        			<h2 id="vera">PEACE AND ORDER</h2>
              <p>In addition to our first principle, peace and order are important elements which must absolutely be included in our principles because within our association, must reign this peace and this order but also around us. > It is often said: Either what you want to see change around you. <br> We come mostly from African countries, countries that experience disorders in the event of political elections or crises. <br> How can we move forward, participate in globalization and be leaders on the international scene if we do not know how to keep peace and order within our countries? <br> What image do we give off?</p>

        			<h2 id="ora">DEFENSE OF THE BLACK</h2>
              <p>Our skin color in this society has been persecuted for centuries. <br> It tells our colonial history but also brings out the prejudices that we face every day in this world. <br> This is why our principle n3 is entitled the defense of black. <br> Black is synonymous with laziness, theft, stupidity, animal, fear, treachery, inferior, sexually savage, disease, less serious ... etc. <br > The list is long in reality, which is why, in front of all these determinants of black, we want and must work to change the perception of black and to change mentalities in black, because being black is also having a complex psychology.</p>

        			<h2 id="vera">WOMEN</h2>
              <p>The feminine is another of our very important principles because women are part of our association and of society. <br> Let’s talk about excision, rape, mistreatment, unfairness in social and professional environment, marginalization, demonization of the feminine sex… <br> Yes, being a woman, in addition to being black, is to live another fight in everyday life. <br> This is why part of our actions will be focused on sex education of young girls and learning to fully accept their body as well as its valuation. <br> We will break the myths aiming to teach women that there is only man to put her in value within this society and that it cannot manage and get out of it alone.</p>

        			<h2 id="ora">EDUCATION</h2>
              <p>Education involves cultural and behavioral awareness where new generations acquire the lifestyles of previous generations. <br> Formal or school education is the systematic presentation of ideas, facts and techniques to students. <br> One person exercises an ordered and voluntary influence over another in order to train them. <br> Thus, the school system is the way in which a society transmits and maintains its collective existence among the new generations. <br> Our association has aim to act in both cases, especially in Africa, in our countries of origin because one of our objectives is to allow Africans to heal from their colonial legacy in order to move forward and be competitive and this cannot be do without going through formal and cultural education.</p>

        			<h2 id="vera">INTELLECT</h2>
              <p>As leaders and mentors, <br> We must be on the lookout for the political and economic life of our country of origin as well as internationally, because to be a leader is to be or to become a complete character, <br> It is to defend one's opinions with firmness and confidence in public, <br> It is to create movements and motivate others to join them, <br> This is why we must be intellectually armed to best reflect our qualification. <br> This is why we will make sure to provide daily news to the members of the group and initiate debates a few times on the subjects drawn by vote.</p>

                <h2 id="ora">RIGOR AND DISCIPLINE</h2>
                <p>To be a leader like to be a parent, <br> It is to have or acquire and develop a certain rigor, <br> Discipline and above all consistency in this acquisition because we are and will be responsible for other people. <br> We are and we will be the shepherds of a large flock so more than a quality, it is an integral part of us which must marry rigor and discipline. <br> It is a personal work but together we can also help each other to become more rigorous and disciplined.</p>

                  <h2 id="vera">LOYALTY</h2>
                  <p>Loyalty includes loyalty. <br> That is to say that we are not only faithful but we are loyal, we are more than faithful because loyalty never dies and survives hard times better. <br> La loyalty includes total trust in the other, surrender to the other because we are sure that the other is a part of us. Loyalty implies: sincerity, righteousness, reliability, honesty, truth, frankness , loyalty, regularity, constancy, seriousness, responsibility, respect, trust, dedication. <br> It is a great value of soul.</p>

                    <h2 id="ora">UNIQUENESS</h2>
                    <p>Uniqueness is our last principle because we must all agree on all of the previous principles after exploring them and adhere to them firmly and deeply. <br> Only then will we get to act together to create change. <br> So uniqueness can be considered as a personal reflection, it's time to ask yourself whether or not, individually we can stand in this association and contribute to it.</p>
